# Upstox MCP Server

A MCP server for integrating with the Upstox trading API.
There is no official MCP server for Upstox, so this is our implementation of a MCP server for Upstox to get information from our account.

## Quick Start

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Finance-LLMs/Upstox-MCP-Server.git
cd Upstox-MCP-Server
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### Run the Server

To start the MCP server:
```bash
npm run start
```

Your MCP server will be running at `http://localhost:8787`

## MCP Configuration

### Claude Desktop Configuration

To use this MCP server with Claude Desktop, add the following configuration to your Claude Desktop settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-server-upstox-api": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "http://localhost:8787/sse"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Cursor MCP Configuration

To use this MCP server with Cursor, add the following configuration to your Cursor MCP settings (usually located at `~/.cursor/mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-server-upstox-api": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8787/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

These configurations allow Claude Desktop and Cursor to connect to your local MCP server and use the Upstox API endpoints.
